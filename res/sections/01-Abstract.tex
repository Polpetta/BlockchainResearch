In this essay we will speak about Blockchain, a sort of distributed database
mostly used in cryptocurrencies to store transactions.

Related to cryptocurrencies, Blockchain solves the double-spending problem and
is involved in the procedure called ``mining''. An important feature that this
distributed system is able to offer is privacy. Thus, this aspect allow people
to perform pseudo-anonymous payments.

Blockchain is not only restricted to cryptocurrencies though, and it has a wide
range of uses, for instance from IoT devices to access-control manager.

Finally, we will analyze Smart Contracts, a new way to automatize transactions
and to create personal tokens in cryptocurrencies.
