This essay is about Blockchain, a sort of distributed database, mostly used in
cryptocurrencies to store transactions.

Related to cryptocurrencies, Blockchain solves the double-spending problem and
it is involved in a procedure called ``mining''. An important feature that
this distributed system is able to offer is privacy, allowing people to perform
pseudo-anonymous payments.

Blockchain is not only restricted to cryptocurrencies though, and it has a wide
range of uses, from IoT devices to access-control manager.

Finally, we will analyze Smart Contracts, a new way to automatize transactions
and to create personal tokens in cryptocurrencies.
