In this essay we will speak about Blockchain, a sort of distributed database
used mostly in cryptocurrencies to store transactions. %non andrebbe meglio "mostly used"?

Related to cryptocurrencies, Blockchain solves the double-spending problem and
is involved in the procedure called `mining'. An important feature that this
database is able to offer is privacy. Thus, this aspect allow people to perform
pseudo-anonymous payments.

Blockchain is not only restricted to cryptocurrencies though, and it has a wide
range of uses, for instance from IoT devices to access-control manager.

Finally, we will analyze Smart Contracts, a new way to automatize transactions
and to create personal tokens in cryptocurrencies.
